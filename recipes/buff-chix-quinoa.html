                <li>1/2 cup hot sauce (I recommend Franks!)</li>
                <li>1/3 cup olive oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
                <li>3/4 pound boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
                <li>1 cup broccoli florets</li>
                <li>3/4 cup shredded carrots</li>
                <li>3/4 cup shredded cabbage</li>
                <li>1/2 cup blue cheese crumbles plus more for garnish</li>
                <li>1 avocado, sliced</li>
                <li>4 green onions chopped</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook the quinoa according to package directions.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, make the buffalo sauce dressing.  In a medium bowl combine the olive oil, hot sauce, and seasoned salt.  Whisk to combine.  Set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat a medium size skillet over medium high heat.  Add a tablespoon of olive oil and cook the chicken for about 5 minutes or until cooked through.  Add 1/4 cup or so of the buffalo sauce and cook until the chicken absorbs the sauce.  Add the broccoli and cook 3-5 minutes or until the broccoli is tender.  Remove from the heat.</li>
                <li>In a large salad bowl, toss together the cooked quinoa, chicken, broccoli, carrots, shredded cabbage, and as much of the dressing as desired.  Add the blue cheese and half of the green onions.  Toss again and sever warm with extra blue cheese crumbles, the remaining green onions, and avocado.</li>
            </ol>
