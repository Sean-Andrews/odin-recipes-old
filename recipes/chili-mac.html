        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This <strong>Healthy Chili Mac</strong> is the perfect pairing of two of my favorite meals: chili and mac and cheese.</p>
        <p>This healthy meal is perfectly portioned for the 21 Day Fix, and gluten-free, too!  This is a healthy meal for the whole family.</p>

                <li>In a large pot or dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium heat and then saute the ground turkey or beef until nearly cooked through.</li>
                <li>Add in onions, bell peppers, and saute for a couple minutes until fragrant and veggies begin to soften.  Then add in garlic and zucchini, cooking for an additional minute.</li>
                <li>Mix seasonings and salt into tomato sauce.  Add sauce to veggie mixture, along with the beans and diced tomatoes.  Cook for 10 minutes to let flavors meld together and the liquid to reduce.</li>
